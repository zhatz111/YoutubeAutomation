I am a recovering alcoholic of 2 years, and there has been a long history of alcoholism and addiction in my family. My now ex-boyfriend, who we'll call Sean, were together for almost a year. He knows about my past with alcohol and my family's history and was respectful of it, or so I thought.
My birthday was 2 days ago, and my boyfriend was being super sweet. He took me out to my favorite restaurant and we watched my favorite movie together. Everything was nice and romantic until it came time for him to give me my gift. He got a huge grin on his face and ran out to his car. This made me sort of excited, and he came inside and gave me my gift.
I opened the box, and inside was a bottle of wine. My heart dropped. His smile grew, and he asked me if I liked it. I got angry and asked what the fuck he was thinking. He told me "it was just a joke" and that I'm being over dramatic. I yelled and told him my past addiction was not a joke.
He said that I couldn't handle a joke and that he's a prankster. He's pulled small pranks before, but they were usually small and silly. This was something else, it felt like a slap in the face. I told him if this was his idea of a joke then we would have to break up.
He got angry and started yelling about how I couldn't take a joke. I told him to leave and that I would talk to him in the morning. He got up in my face and told me that I couldn't make him leave and started made threats. He's a very strong man, but this was the first time I felt threatened by him. I told him that the cops could make him leave. He glared at me for few more seconds than left.
I've blocked him and haven't talked to him since.
